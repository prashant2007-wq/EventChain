Techblocks on 15th

The 5-day technical event is happening! The dates are from 15th of Jan to 19th of Jan. It would be extremely fun event, with a choice of 4 domains. You could choose any domain to study, from Agentic-AI, Flutter Dev, Web Dev, or ECE. You would be taught by second year students, not by your teachers. They would create very engaging slides, and it would be a hands-on session. You would surely enjoy it.
